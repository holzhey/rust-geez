## Starfield

Just a fun starfield to play around with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Ggez](https://ggez.rs/) framework.

Starfields were pretty common in [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) computers and you can implement this in very different ways on that computer.

With modern computer you benefit from a different type of hardware capabilities. Ggez uses [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/), so i will try different approaches as well here.
